# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome !

## A little about myself:

* Joined the Navy as Electronics Technician but performed primary duties as System Administrator
* Separating from the Navy in October 2023 with 5+ years of technical experience
* Finishing Bachelors in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance
* Obtained A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications from CompTia
* Passion for learning and problem solving
* I have always loved taking things apart and learning its inner workings. This is why I love tinkering with new technologies. For this reason the Cybersecurity field is perfect for me because it is constantly changing and there is always something new to learn
