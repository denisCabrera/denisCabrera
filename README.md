  I decided to create this gitbook to share and store things I have been
  learning in school and other side projects.

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome !

## A little about myself:

* Joined the Navy as Electronics Technician but performed primary duties as System Administrator
* I am separating from the Navy in October 2023 with 5+ years of technical experience
* I am enrolled at WGU perusing a Bachelors in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance
* I posses A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications from CompTia
* I have a passion for learning and problem solving.&#x20;
* I always loved taking things apart and learning how they work. This is why I love tinkering with new technologies. For this reason the Cybersecurity field is perfect for me because it is constantly changing and there is always something new to learn.
